                Backend Lead for team11 of CSC648. I'm working towards a computer
                science major at San Francisco <br />
                State University. I've had many experiences with java but recently
                have started learning many other language <br />
                such as ruby and swift. My dream job would be anything that has to do
                with servers because it's something I <br />
                have worked with before even thinking about being a computer major{" "}
